# Texas Instruments LM386 Amplifier Circuit

This project involved using a cheap solid-state audio amplifier chip to create an amplifier circuit intended to accompany my cheap electric guitar. The circuit contained resistors, capacitors (both non-polar and polar), a logarithmic potentiometer (for input volume control) and adaptors/plugs. A full spec sheet/schematic can be found here: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf. The circuit was based off of figures 12 and 14.

**I ended up overdriving the speaker and blowing it. In ![VID_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainlou/lm386-audio-amp/master/VID_1.mp4) it worked pretty well, but as you can see in ![VID_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainlou/lm386-audio-amp/master/VID_2.mp4) and ![VID_3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainlou/lm386-audio-amp/master/VID_3.mp4), there is significant distortion after around 5 minutes of operation. Maybe when I build a high quality tube amp in the future I'll make sure not to mess things up lol.**
