This repository contains hardware projects that I've completed or am currently working on.

Skills I've learned:
* Soldering/desoldering (with desoldering braid and pump)
* Electrical wiring management (keeping it nice and clean)
* Cutting metal with hand shear and vertical band saw
* CAD design (KiCad): schematic, PCB layout, managing footprints
