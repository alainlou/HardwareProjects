# Texas Instruments LM386 Amplifier Circuit

This project involved using a cheap solid-state audio amplifier chip to create an amplifier circuit intended to accompany my cheap electric guitar. The circuit contained resistors, capacitors (both non-polar and polar), a logarithmic potentiometer (for input volume) and adaptors/plugs. A full spec sheet/schematic can be found here: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf. The circuit was based off of figures 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 .

**I ended up overdriving the speaker and blowing it. In VID_1 it worked pretty well, but as you can see in VID_2 and VID_3, there is significant distortion after around 5 minutes of operation. Maybe when I build a high quality tube amp in the future I'll make sure not to mess things up lol.**
