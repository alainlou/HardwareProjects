# KiCad

This folder contains projects I've completed or am fiddling about on using KiCad, an open-source EDA software.

Most of the project names are self-descriptive:
* **[Custom Arduino](https://github.com/alainlou/HardwareProjects/tree/master/KiCad/Custom%20Arduino)** - a reverse-engineered Arduino-style microcontroller board
